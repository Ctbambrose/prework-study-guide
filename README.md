# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
The project gave me the chance to solve a problem that I myself encounter a regular basis when it comes to not only studying, but learning new thing on the job. I have a hard time keeping track of my notes and if I do know where they are located, they tend to be disjoined and not have all of the location in single location that is easy for reference. The project allowed me to not only have a single location where my notes are kept, but they are easily accessible from the web. I was also able to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as learn about Git and GitHub for the first time.

## Usage

The project has two main functionalities that can be used to assist you in studying. The first is obvious when the page launches, it displays the four main subjects that were covered in the prework section. The subject has been formatted to show all the notes you have taken for that subject below it, as well as being surrounded by a box to keep all the information sorted neatly in its own section. The second functionality that can assist you with studying is not as obvious, that is why a note is located at the top stating “Open the Console to See what’s Happening”. When you open the DevTools console you can see the Jaca Script that is running. The console not only shows the four topics that were learned during prework, but it also randomly generates one of the topics to start studying on if you are unsure where to start.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The html element opening tag that represents the root, or start, of HTML document.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport. More info on meta element can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">HERE</a>.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The h1 through h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. 
            In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A color property assigns a color. Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. Try selecting a color and replace the border color with its hex #, which you can find on this <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">HTML Color Codes website</a>.</li>
          <li>A box-shadow property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
